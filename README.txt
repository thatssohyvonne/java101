Hello There!!
Welcome to Java 101

This .java file purely serves the purpose as a one stop for people who just need a one stop answer for the most basic functions.

This 101 is targetted for people who have little to some background in coding and by no means should serve as a tutorial of how Java is used.

If you are looking for a Java tutorial, I highly recommend that you go onto youtube, W3School, stackoverflow etc. if you are just starting out coding.

If there are portions that you do not understand, a link is usually placed in the code as reference so that you can read more about it.

This 101 serves as a template. Ideally you should try each line of code on your own as you read the file so and test it out as you go! This way, you can see how it all unfolds.

NOTES:
1. This file was coded on Netbeans IDE 8.0.2, you can still view it on other IDEs but just throwing it out there. So if anyone who is literally a beginner and scared it doesnt open, here you go!
2. This file is coded on a Windows 10 Operating System Environment (sorry to all the pros but I am just a noob student). So if you are a Linux user, some of these code lines or functions may be different. I highly recommend that you google if you are a Linux user. 
3. If you are using a Windows 8 Operating System or lower, you need to know that some of the steps MAY DIFFER!! Please dont assume that it is windows and expect the same steps. If it differs, try to google it and find the difference.

This file currently contains:
- How to set up Java environment
- How to execute Java on cmd
- User input
- Declaring Variables
- Printing Variables 
- Printing Statements
- Array

Sound off in the comments area or put in an issue if you would like to see more and specify what are you looking for! If it doesnt work for you, let me know to and I will try my best to find the code that would work on most platforms.
