Welcome to Java 101

These files purely serves the purpose as a one stop for people who just need a one stop answer for the most basic functions.

This 101 is targetted for people who have little to some background in coding and by no means should serve as a tutorial of how Java is used. (also cause I lowkey lazy to keep googling for the same thing over and over again)

If you are looking for a Java tutorial, I highly recommend that you go onto youtube, W3School, stackoverflow etc. if you are just starting out coding.

If there are portions that you do not understand, a link is usually placed in the code as reference so that you can read more about it.

This 101 serves as a template. Ideally you should try each line of code on your own as you read the file so and test it out as you go! This way, you can see how it all unfolds.

NOTES:
1. This file was coded on Netbeans IDE 8.0.2, you can still view it on other IDEs but just throwing it out there. So if anyone who is literally a beginner and scared it doesnt open, here you go!

2. This file is coded on a Windows 10 Operating System Environment (sorry to all the pros but I am just a noob student). So if you are a Linux user, some of these code lines or functions may be different. I highly recommend that you google if you are a Linux user. 

3. If you are using a Windows 8 Operating System or lower, you need to know that some of the steps MAY DIFFER!! Please dont assume that it is windows and expect the same steps. If it differs, try to google it and find the difference.

This repo currently contains:
- How to set up Java environment
- How to execute Java on cmd
- User input
- Declaring Variables
- Printing Variables 
- Printing Statements
- Array
- How to execute a .java class file on a main method .java file (see Executor.java and ExecutorClass.java)

Things to note:
1. This file is created for beginners with a little background knowledge to coding, or are jumping from one programming language to Java.

2. This in no way is to serve as a crash course, however most of the basic and necessary functions are available in this tutorial.

3. Do note that you are strongly advised to head down to platforms such as youtube, github, stackoverflow if you are unsure of how do codes run.

4. The purpose of this file is purely cause googling sometimes can be quite painful and annoying when you have many answers but you have no idea which one to follow.

5. These are set ups and code in a Windows 10 environment. 

6a. If you are a Windows 8 and below OR

6b. If you are a Linux user, it may differ for you! Please do not assume that it will work the same! Try and test every line if needed!

7. I will include some links for reading/downloading for things that you may be asking/need.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Some MUST KNOW:
1. to comment use: "//"
2. to end a statement, use ";"
3. if you see a grey underline: it just means that you declared a variable BUT did not use it
4. if you see a red underline: it just means your code got error

-----------------------------------------------------------------
        
Sound off in the comments area or put in an issue if you would like to see more and specify what are you looking for! If it doesnt work for you, let me know to and I will try my best to find the code that would work on most platforms.
