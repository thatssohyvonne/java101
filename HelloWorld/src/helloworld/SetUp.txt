ENVIRONMENT PREPARATION
If you would like to run your code on command prompt (cmd)
Ensure you have the following:
Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
download link: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
        
Java SE RunTime Environment (JRE)
download link: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
        
note that you should download according to what your device is. If your device is a linux, download the linux one. If your device is a windows, you download the windows one. 
        
Ensure that you have the following directories:
c:\Program Files\java\jdk
c:\Program Files\java\jre
These directories are universal for all Windows Operating System
        
To load the environment, follow the directions in: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/install/installation-jdk-and-jre-microsoft-windows-platforms.htm#JSJIG-GUID-96EB3876-8C7A-4A25-9F3A-A2983FEC016A
If you dont understand, please go onto youtube. There are plenty of tutorials available for various operating systems. For first timers, it may be easier to follow using a youtube tutorial.
