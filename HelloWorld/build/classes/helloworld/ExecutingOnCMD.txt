EXECUTION

THIS IS ONLY IF YOU HAVE SET UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT 

to execute the .java file on cmd:

1.check if java is running on the machine
        type: java -version
2. cd to the file directory that .java file is in
3. next run the .java file
        type: javac FileName.java
4.run the class file
        type: java ClassFileName
        
ERROR: Could not find or load main class [SOLUTION]
cd out by one file
example: 
        if HelloWorld.class is located in C:\User\Desktop
        	type: cd C:\User
        	type: java Desktop.HelloWorld

This solution works best if your file is located in another drive
To exit from C drive to your other drive: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11065421/command-prompt-wont-change-directory-to-another-drive
        
If the solution doesnt work, take a look at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18093928/what-does-could-not-find-or-load-main-class-mean
        
NOTE: when you run the command "javac", you will notice a .class file is created.
the .class file will contain hexidecimal numbers and nothing else
1. you dont have to worry about it if you are a beginner. If you would like to understand more, you may read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file
2. you CAN delete the file if you wish. No harm will be done.
